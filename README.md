# EnternainmentLibrary
Description
===========
Making the Library that I've always wanted and needed for the constant Games, Movies, Anime, etc. 
that get released constantly which is quite a pain in the bum to keep track, of since there are so
many resources on the internet.

The Why?
========
By unifying all the different sources with the different platforms (PS, XBOX, Nintendo, Steam, GOG, 
EGS, Crunchyroll, Funimation, IMDB, Kinopoisk, Rotten Tomatoes, Meta Critics, Spotify) it will be 
possible to get all the releases and the list of games, played, completed, watched etc.

The How?
========
It is still in TBD.
